## Description
This Project aims to utilize various iPhone sensors (LiDAR, accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, camera, GPS, etc.) to map a space. The information will be transmitted via WebSockets to a PC, where 3D reconstruction of the space will be performed using point clouds.

Key features include:
- Integration of multiple iPhone sensors for data collection.  
- Data transmission over WebSockets.  
- Processing of point clouds for 3D reconstruction.
